Project Title: AgriConnect â€“ Digitizing Farmers through Cloud and WAN 

In many rural areas of Cameroon, farmers represent a large part of the active population. However, they face many daily challenges: lack of real-time information (weather, market prices, farming techniques), no system for tracking production, difficulty connecting with reliable buyers, and inability to access structured financing. This lack of digital integration limits their productivity and competitiveness.

In response to this situation, my networking company is introducing AgriConnect,a solution based on cloud computing and Wide Area Networks (WAN) to improve farmers' daily lives. The goal is to centralize, automate, and simplify access to useful information through a simple digital platform that remains accessible even in remote areas thanks to WAN.

Cloud computing is a system that allows data or applications to be stored, processed, and accessed via the Internet. For example, Google Drive lets users save files online; Amazon Web Services hosts web applications. With the cloud, farmers can record their harvests, track production history, access video training, and receive personalized advice.


My solution includes:
- A web site available in local languages and French  
- A secure cloud server hosting an agricultural database  
- A WAN connection linking rural areas to the cloud  
- User accounts (farmers, cooperatives, buyers, NGOs)

The flow of information is as follows:
1. The farmer inputs their data (type of crop, planting date, quantities harvested, etc.)  
2. The platform provides automated and updated advice  
3. Buyers can view available local stock  
4. NGOs or cooperatives can plan targeted training sessions

This solution is unique because it combines:
- A simplified interface, adapted to the realities of rural areas  
- An extended network infrastructure to connect forgotten zones  
- A scalable cloud system, to easily expand to other communities

I  chose this problem because it affects a population that is essential to our economy but often left behind in the digital transition. The cloud is essential because it allows centralized updates, automatic backup, and data analysis. The WAN ensures access even without fiber optic infrastructure.
